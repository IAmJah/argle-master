Argle is a free discord self-bot, created by Axxe! We have decided to release it due to the amount of users trying to sell my bot for $30 upwards of $100. One discord server was called Imperium Bot and it is owned by Imperium#6783, the paypal email connected is cracked1attack@gmail.com so i would recommend reporting it to PayPal if you would like to take them down!  Come check out Argle its fully open source and feel-free to use it at your own risk.
